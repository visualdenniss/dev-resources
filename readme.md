# Contribution Guideline: 

- 🍴 Fork the project repository to create a copy of the codebase under your GitHub account.🍴
- 🔧 Make the necessary changes, in this case updating the resources-list.md file. 🔧
- 💾 Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message directly on GitHub. 💾
- 🚫 No need to download your clone and run local since this project will only contain text files - also code editors auto-format 🚫
- 🚫 So please avoid sending a PR coming from an autoformatted local copy 🚫
- 🧩 From your forked repository, create a pull request (PR) to the original repository's branch where you want your changes to be merged into. 🧩
- 🎉 Once your PR is approved, your changes will be merged into the original project repository 🎉

💜 Thanks 💜
